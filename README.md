## This fcuntion is to do automatic single point calibration for Braid system with high accuracy.
May extend this function to replace easywand for Photron cameras in the future.

## How to use:
1. use `unzip_braidz.py` to unzip your braidz file.
2. use `multicam_calibration.py` to do calibration.
3. use `modify_real_coor_gui.py` to adjust the coordinate from the last step to real coordinate.
4. may use `test_xml_reprojection_error.py` to verify the xml accuracy.
